1. Since it is a dynamic app, I have assumed it has a frontend, backend and DB. 
   The users search for the url and then the request will be forwarded to cloudfront.
   First the request will go to S3 and from there it will be sent to the backend. 
   Backend app will check for the data in redis cahche otherwise it will fetch the data from rds reader.
   To write the data, app will directly write into the rds master. App and DB are placed in different private subnet. 
   Nat gateway is placed in public subnet.

2. I have created cloudformation template for Amazon Aurora Rds. 
   The configuration is of master and reader, since it is a managed service the disk size and iops will be managed by aws. 
   If we need more instances then we can also enable auto scaling of reader instances.

3. I have used fetch module to copy a file from remote host to our local machine. 
   Since we are copying a file from multiple instances, we can store the file in different folders based on hostname or some other variable.
   We can use ansible dynamic inventory to get all the required hosts by their tags and then we can run the script to copy the required file.
